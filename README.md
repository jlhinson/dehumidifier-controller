# dehumidifier-controller

I started making a controller for an Ultra-Aire dehumidifier, but decided to switch to a Santa-Fe dehumidifier which has a built in humidity control. I will keep the project for reference but will most likely move to building a remote temperature and humidity sensor to put in the crawl space.
